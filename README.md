CAN simulation framework for rLoop avionics developement
For help getting started talk to @vookungdoofu in #eng-software


CANVAS (CAN Virtual Approximation Simulator) is meant to simulate the behaviour of the hardware nodes and CAN bus in the flight 
version of rPod. This is still an early "beta" version of the framework. Currently it simulates the adressing scheme of CAN nodes, but not the 
bus arbitration or message priority mechanics. This will change in later versions.
